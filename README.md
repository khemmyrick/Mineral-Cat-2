# MINERAL CATALOG v2


# Overview

Picking up where the first MineralCat project left off, MineralCat 2.0 ups the functionality with:
	- More search options!
	- Docked menus!
	- All the buttons you can click!


# New Features in 2.0:
1. Allows filtering by the first letter of the mineral name.
	- Links displayed at top of page for each letter of the alphabet.
	- When a letter is clicked, a list of minerals that start with that letter is displayed!
	- The letter currently being shown will be in bold, so you know where you are.


2. Allows text search.
	- A search box is displayed at the top of the page.
	- When the search button is clicked, the site will search for minerals whose fields contains the search text.
	- The resulting names of the minerals that match the search will then be displayed, for your convenience.

3. Allows filtering by group.
	- Minerals may be filtered by group!  Simply click one of the links on the left side of the page.
	- Clicking a group name, will uncover all of the minerals in the database that are in that group.
	- The group name being displayed will also be bolded, for your convenience.
	- (Please Note: Group List view now renders directly to the mineral list template.  Group List template is now deprecated.)

4. Optimized database queries!
	- Get all of your queries in 5ms or less, or your money back!

5. Allows filtering by color.
	- Colorless is the new white and green is the new red!  Now filter your minerals by possible color with a menu to your right!
